# GAN-DRL-Supply-Chain-Optimization

## Description

This research project explores the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for robust supply chain optimization.  Traditional supply chain optimization methods often struggle with the inherent uncertainties of real-world scenarios (fluctuating demand, unpredictable lead times, disruptions). This project aims to develop a data-driven framework that can handle these uncertainties, outperforming traditional optimization methods.

The project leverages a GAN to generate realistic synthetic supply chain data, encompassing diverse scenarios of demand, lead times, and disruptions.  A DRL agent is then trained within this simulated environment to learn optimal policies for inventory management, procurement, and logistics.


## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Explore the notebooks:**  The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and GAN validation.
4.  **Run experiments:** The `src/main.py` script is the main entry point for running experiments.  You may need to modify this script to configure your specific experimental setup.
